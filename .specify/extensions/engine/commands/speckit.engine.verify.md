# Verify — earn the review state (US8)

The certification pass. Runs **automatically after `/speckit-converge`** (wired as a required
`after_converge` hook, priority 20 — after that event's ClickUp sync) and can also be invoked
directly at any time. It makes the AI do everything it can to verify the feature, and only on
success advances the card to `in-review`. `in-review` therefore means "the AI verified all it
could" — not merely "converge finished".

Stop on the first failure — never advance to `in-review` over a red gate or an unresolved review
finding (FR-034). The card stays at `in-development`.

## Pre-execution: dispatch `before_verify` hooks

Read `hooks.before_verify` from `.specify/extensions.yml` and execute each enabled entry in
priority order (mandatory entries run automatically), exactly like the core commands'
pre-execution hook flow. The ClickUp plug wires a sync here that freshens the card — completed
checklist lines, subtask states — so the mirror is current before certification begins (status
holds `in-development`).

## Steps (in order; stop on first failure)

1. **Recursive code review** — invoke the consolidated review module with target `code`:

   Invoke the `review-loop` module with argument `code` (read and follow
   `.specify/extensions/review-loop/commands/speckit.review-loop.run.md`; the module's targets
   are `spec | analysis | code` — FR-037, consolidated per Constitution VII). It recursively reviews the implemented code + tests for the
   active feature: correctness against spec/plan/tasks, obvious bugs, missing/mismatched tests for
   the tasks just implemented, and constitution violations (e.g. deterministic logic that belongs
   in a tested `scripts/bash/*.sh`). It fixes the unambiguous issues each pass and returns
   **pass** (nothing fixable remains, no attention-needing findings) or **needs-attention**.
   - **needs-attention → STOP.** Report the findings; leave the card at `in-development`.

2. **Full unit gate** — run the project's check gate. It MUST pass.

   ```bash
   npm run check:all      # or the project's equivalent (shell lint + every *.test.sh)
   ```
   - **red → STOP.** Report the failure; leave the card at `in-development` (FR-005/006).

3. **Automatable E2E** — drive whatever end-to-end testing the AI can automate **for the feature
   at hand** (FR-002): exercise the real flow as far as available tooling allows (apply
   migrations, seed/clean up data, invoke real inputs/CLI/APIs/MCP, read back real results).
   Record what you could NOT exercise and why — that goes into the handoff (do not silently skip).
   An un-automatable E2E slice is *reported*, not a hard stop; a *failing* automatable E2E is a
   stop.

4. **Advance to `in-review`** — only if steps 1–3 passed:
   - Set the marker:
     ```bash
     .specify/extensions/engine/scripts/bash/manifest.sh set-lifecycle --key verifyPassed --value true
     ```
   - **Dispatch the `after_verify` hooks**: read `hooks.after_verify` from
     `.specify/extensions.yml` and execute each enabled entry in priority order, exactly like the
     core commands' post-execution hook flow (mandatory entries run automatically). The ClickUp
     plug wires its sync here, advancing the card to `in-review` (the derive helper reads
     `verifyPassed`). If the plug is disabled/uninstalled, the event has no entries and this is a
     silent no-op — verify still succeeds (the marker is the source of truth).

## Handoff report (produced in the flow — the US1 capability, FR-004)

Emit an honest end-of-verify handoff, in the flow (no committed HANDOFF file):
- what the feature does and where it lives;
- what was verified automatically, with evidence (gate output, test counts, E2E results read
  back);
- what remains **manual** and **why** each item could not be automated (the irreducible slice);
- any follow-ups / known gaps surfaced during verification.

This same handoff capability is reused by `/speckit-engine-close`.

## Outcomes
- **Pass** → `verifyPassed` recorded, card `in-review`, handoff produced.
- **Fail at any required step** → card stays `in-development`, `verifyPassed` NOT set, failure
  surfaced. `in-review` is reachable ONLY through a passing verify.

## Never
- Never advances to `in-review` over a red gate or an unresolved review finding.
- Never signs off manual tasks or moves the card to `done` — that is `/speckit-engine-close`.
- Never writes back into repo artifacts based on tracker state (Constitution I).
