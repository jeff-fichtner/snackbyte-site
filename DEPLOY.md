# Deploying

This app deploys to **Google Cloud Run**, fronted by a **global external HTTPS load
balancer**. Apps can share one GCP project (each its own Cloud Run service + subdomain on
the shared LB). The GCP/infra model below is **as-built and proven** — it's what actually
works end to end, distilled from standing up the first apps in the project.

Placeholders used throughout: `<project>` (GCP project id), `<service>` (Cloud Run service
= app name), `<owner>/<repo>` (GitHub repo), `<region>` (e.g. `us-central1`), `<LB-IP>`
(the load balancer's static IP), `<deployer-SA>` (the build/deploy service account),
`<project-number>` (numeric GCP project number).

## The model in one paragraph

The **branch selects the environment**: push `main` → production, push `dev` → staging. On
push, CI (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) runs the quality gate and, on pass, **derives a
version tag from the existing git tags and pushes only that tag** — it never commits
anything. A chained `deploy` job (per-app — see below) authenticates to GCP via **Workload
Identity Federation** (keyless), runs a Cloud Build (`cloudbuild.yaml`) that builds the
`Dockerfile` and deploys to Cloud Run. No manual version bump, no commit pushed back to the
branch, no long-lived secret. A `vX.Y.Z` tag means "passed checks and deployed to prod";
`vX.Y.Z-dev` means "…to staging."

## Versioning — derived from tags, never committed

This is the core of the release model; read it before the deploy mechanics.

- **`package.json` holds `MAJOR.MINOR` only** (e.g. `1.4`). The **PATCH is not stored in the
  repo** — it is a global, monotonic **build id** derived from the git tags that already
  exist. Bump `MAJOR.MINOR` by hand (an ordinary commit) for a meaningful release.
- **CI commits nothing.** It creates a tag on the pushed commit and pushes only the tag. There
  is no `chore: release` commit, no `[skip ci]`, no `npm version`. Because nothing is committed
  back, `dev` and `main` never diverge: fast-forward, merge, and PR promotion all work, with no
  resync and no tag collisions.
- **One symmetric rule, both branches** (`scripts/derive-version.sh`):
  1. **Reuse** if the opposite-stream tag is on _this exact commit_ (`git tag --points-at HEAD`)
     — on `dev`, a prod tag; on `main`, a `-dev` tag. This is a fast-forward promotion or
     resync; the number is reused (suffix added/dropped), so the commit ends up dual-tagged.
  2. **Otherwise advance** to `max(all vMM.* tags) + 1`. The max is over **every** tag (prod and
     `-dev`, both branches), so two commits can never share a number — **collisions are
     structurally impossible**.
- **Accepted trade-offs** (both intentional): the patch is **not in the repo** (only in tags +
  the built image + `/api/version`); and prod patch numbers **have gaps** — a number consumed on
  one branch (a `main` hotfix) raises the next mint on the other, so `dev` skips ahead. The patch
  is a build id, not a release counter; gaps are normal and informative.
- **First push mints the first tag** automatically: a fresh app pushing `main` with no tags gets
  `vMM.0` (and `dev` gets `vMM.0-dev`), regardless of how many commits precede it. The only
  refusal is a **shallow checkout** (which would hide tags and mis-derive) — the workflow uses
  `fetch-depth: 0` and the derivation fails loudly if the clone is shallow.

### Promotion `dev` → `main` (the gate)

Promote by bringing `main` up to the `dev` commit so it is a **fast-forward** (`main` ⊆ `dev`).
That guarantees the `vX.Y.Z-dev` tag is on `main`'s new HEAD, so `main` **reuses that number**
(drops the `-dev` suffix) rather than minting a fresh one — prod ships the exact number staging
validated. The fast-forward requirement also makes **divergent `dev` code unpromotable**: if
`dev` hasn't absorbed a `main` hotfix, it can't fast-forward, so it can't carry stale code to
prod under a wrong number. Enforce it with branch protection's "require branches up to date
before merging" (see below); follow it as a reflex regardless (update `dev` from `main` before
promoting).

## TL;DR — ship a change

1. **To production:** commit to `main` and push. CI runs `npm run check:all`, derives + pushes a
   `vX.Y.Z` tag, then the chained `deploy` job builds and deploys.
2. **To staging:** commit to `dev` and push → `vX.Y.Z-dev` → staging on `<app>.snackbyte.dev`.
3. **Promote:** fast-forward `main` to the `dev` commit (see the gate above) → prod on
   `<app>.snackbyte.io`, reusing the staging number.
4. Verify through the load balancer (NOT the `*.run.app` URL — it's 404 by design):

   ```bash
   curl -s --resolve <host>:443:<LB-IP> https://<host>/api/version
   ```

   `/api/version` returns `{number, commit, buildDate, environment}` — the runtime record of
   what's deployed. Staging additionally returns an `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header; production
   does not.

**Manual deploy** anytime (no CI): `./scripts/deploy.sh <service> <project> <region> [version]`.
This runs `gcloud run deploy --source .`. The version is whatever you pass (or `git describe`),
not a `package.json` patch.

**Recovery — tag pushed but the deploy failed** (transient GCP/GitHub error): the tag exists but
prod wasn't updated, and re-running the whole workflow would hit the fail-loud "tag exists"
guard. Just **re-run the `deploy` job alone** against the existing tag — `deploy` keys off the
tag and doesn't re-derive, so the guard is never engaged. (A _code_ failure is instead fixed by a
new commit → new tag; the orphaned tag harmlessly becomes a build id with no deploy.)

## The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

One workflow, triggered on push + PR to both `main` and `dev`:

1. `validate (merge gate)` (PRs only): runs `npm run check:all`. A PR can't merge until it passes
   — but **only if branch protection requires it** (see below); the workflow can run a check, it
   can't _enforce_ the merge.
2. `version-and-tag` (push only): re-runs `npm run check:all` (the authoritative gate) plus
   `npm run test:release` (proves the derivation itself), then derives + pushes the tag.
3. `deploy` (push, `needs: version-and-tag`): **per-app** — it names your GCP project, service
   account, and WIF provider, and selects the target from the branch (`dev` → `<service>-staging`
   - `APP_ENV=staging`; `main` → `<service>` + no `APP_ENV`). The template ships `validate` +
     `version-and-tag`; add `deploy` from the snippet in the infra runbook below.

The tag is pushed with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`permissions: contents: write`). A
`GITHUB_TOKEN`-pushed tag does **not** trigger another workflow (GitHub's recursion guard), which
is fine: the deploy is a chained `needs:` job in the **same** run, so no second event is needed
and no personal access token is required.

## One-time CI setup (per repo): authorize the tag push and the merge gate

### Allow Actions to push tags

The `version-and-tag` job pushes the version tag back to the repo. That requires the repo to
allow Actions to write:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/permissions/workflow \
  -f default_workflow_permissions=write
```

(Or web UI: **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Read and write
permissions" → Save**.) Set this _before_ the first push, or the gate passes but the tag step
403s. (Fix: enable it, then re-run the failed job.)

### Branch protection (the merge gate is repo config, not YAML)

The workflow can _run_ `check:all` on a PR, but it cannot _require_ it for merge — that is branch
protection, a repo setting. Ship it as a one-time `gh api` call on **both** `main` and `dev`:

```bash
for BRANCH in main dev; do
  gh api -X PUT "repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/${BRANCH}/protection" \
    --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "required_status_checks": { "strict": false, "contexts": ["validate (merge gate)"] },
  "required_pull_request_reviews": null,
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "restrictions": null,
  "allow_force_pushes": true
}
JSON
done
```

The knobs, each deliberate:

- **`contexts: ["validate (merge gate)"]`** — the required check is the **job name**, not the
  `ci-cd / …` UI label. Get it wrong and the check is never matched.
- **`required_pull_request_reviews: null`** — do **not** require PRs. Requiring them breaks the
  fast-forward promotion model (a fast-forward isn't a PR).
- **`enforce_admins: false`** — admin override is the explicit at-own-risk escape hatch.
- **`allow_force_pushes: true`** — needed for the fast-forward/promotion flows.

The authoritative backstop is the push-side gate: `version-and-tag` re-runs `check:all` and tags
only on pass, so a tag (hence a deploy) exists only if the gate passed — true for PR-merge,
admin-override, and direct/FF push alike.

## One-time GCP setup (per app)

In dependency order. Most of this is one-time _per project_ and reused by every app; the
genuinely per-app bits are flagged.

### 1. APIs

```bash
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  artifactregistry.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com \
  iamcredentials.googleapis.com secretmanager.googleapis.com \
  certificatemanager.googleapis.com \
  cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com --project=<project>
```

(Run + Cloud Build + Artifact Registry for the build/deploy. Compute for the load balancer.
IAM Credentials for WIF. Certificate Manager for the cert-map TLS model. Secret Manager +
Resource Manager for the optional connected-repo link / any 2nd-gen Cloud Build resources.)

### 2. Workload Identity Federation (keyless auth — no JSON key anywhere)

One pool/provider serves the whole project; reuse it for every repo.

```bash
# Pool + provider (issuer = GitHub's OIDC), restricted to your GitHub org/owner:
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create github-pool \
  --project=<project> --location=global --display-name="GitHub pool"
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers create-oidc github-provider \
  --project=<project> --location=global --workload-identity-pool=github-pool \
  --issuer-uri="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  --attribute-mapping="google.subject=assertion.sub,attribute.repository=assertion.repository,attribute.repository_owner=assertion.repository_owner" \
  --attribute-condition="assertion.repository_owner == '<owner>'"
```

Then let **only this repo** impersonate the deploy SA (per-app — one binding per repo):

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding <deployer-SA> \
  --project=<project> --role="roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser" \
  --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/<project-number>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool/attribute.repository/<owner>/<repo>"
```

### 3. Deploy service account (user-managed — required)

A build that runs with an **explicit** `--service-account` must use a **user-managed** SA;
the Google-managed Cloud Build SA (`…@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`) is rejected at run
time with `INVALID_ARGUMENT: provide a user-managed service account`.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create <name> --project=<project> \
  --display-name="Tag deploy (Cloud Build)"   # => <deployer-SA>
```

Project roles it needs: `roles/run.admin`, `roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor`,
`roles/artifactregistry.writer`, `roles/storage.admin`, `roles/logging.logWriter`
(required because the build uses `logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY`).

`actAs` (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`) bindings — **both** matter:

```bash
# (a) on the compute runtime SA — Cloud Run runs the service as the compute SA:
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  <project-number>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
  --project=<project> --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser" \
  --member="serviceAccount:<deployer-SA>"

# (b) on ITSELF — the workflow authenticates AS <deployer-SA> (via WIF) and then submits a
#     build that runs AS <deployer-SA>; without self-actAs the submit fails with
#     "PERMISSION_DENIED: caller does not have permission to act as service account".
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding <deployer-SA> \
  --project=<project> --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser" \
  --member="serviceAccount:<deployer-SA>"
```

### 4. Cloud Run service — ingress AND invoker (both required)

Two independent controls, and you need **both**:

- **Ingress:** deploy with `--ingress=internal-and-cloud-load-balancing` so the service rejects
  direct `*.run.app` traffic and the load balancer is the only front door. **Consequence:** the
  `run.app` URL returns **404 by design** — always test through the LB / your hostname.
- **Invoker:** bind `allUsers` to `roles/run.invoker` (or deploy `--allow-unauthenticated`, which
  is the same binding). **Ingress alone is not enough** — without the invoker binding the LB's
  forwarded requests get a **Google-frontend `403`** (an HTML 403 from Google's infra, not your
  app). The 403-through-the-LB-with-an-ACTIVE-cert symptom is the signature of a missing invoker.

```bash
gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding <service> \
  --member=allUsers --role=roles/run.invoker --project=<project> --region=<region>
```

Ingress is the lockdown; the invoker is the grant. A public site needs both (the ingress lock is
about _path_, not _authz_).

### 5. Load balancer + TLS (one-time per project, shared by all apps)

Cloud Run's built-in domain mapping **can't serve an apex domain** and **isn't GA in every
region** (e.g. `us-central1`), so it's the wrong tool. Stand up a **global external HTTPS load
balancer** once; every app rides it on a different hostname.

Resources (one set per project): a global static IP (`<LB-IP>`, the DNS target), a serverless
NEG → backend service → URL map → HTTPS proxy + forwarding rule (:443), plus an HTTP forwarding
rule (:80) that 301-redirects to HTTPS.

**TLS is a Certificate Manager cert-MAP, not a classic SSL cert.** When a cert map is attached to
the HTTPS proxy it takes precedence, so adding a SAN to a classic cert is a **no-op**. A second
TLD needs its **own** per-domain DNS authorization, a managed cert, and cert-map entries — you
cannot reuse another domain's authorization. Use a **wildcard** so future subdomain apps need no
cert work:

```bash
# Per TLD, once: a wildcard-capable DNS authorization (PER_PROJECT_RECORD, not FIXED_RECORD),
# a managed cert covering the apex + wildcard, and cert-map entries pointing at it.
gcloud certificate-manager dns-authorizations create <tld>-dnsauth \
  --domain="<tld>" --type=PER_PROJECT_RECORD --project=<project>
gcloud certificate-manager certificates create <tld>-cert \
  --domains="<tld>,*.<tld>" --dns-authorizations=<tld>-dnsauth --project=<project>
gcloud certificate-manager maps entries create <tld>-apex \
  --map=<cert-map> --certificates=<tld>-cert --hostname="<tld>" --project=<project>
gcloud certificate-manager maps entries create <tld>-wild \
  --map=<cert-map> --certificates=<tld>-cert --hostname="*.<tld>" --project=<project>
```

The wildcard pre-solves TLS for the whole TLD — a future `<app>.<tld>` then needs only its own
Cloud Run service + NEG + backend + url-map host-rule + one DNS `A` record, **no cert work**.
(Caveat: `*.<tld>` is single-label — covers `app.<tld>` but not `x.app.<tld>`.)

**DNS is registrar-gated and partly manual.** If the TLD is hosted at an external registrar
(GoDaddy, etc.) and Cloud DNS is not enabled, gcloud **cannot** create the records — an operator
must add them by hand. Two records per domain:

1. `CNAME _acme-challenge[...] → <id>.authorize.certificatemanager.goog` — emitted by the
   dns-authorization; the managed cert won't go `ACTIVE` until it resolves.
2. `A @ → <LB-IP>` (apex), `CNAME www → @` (mirrors the apex). **Leave MX records alone**
   (Workspace email).

Set a low **TTL (600)** on records you'll later flip (a cutover then propagates in ~10 min). A
managed cert goes `ACTIVE` only after DNS validates (~15–60 min). A static public IP is expected —
security is at the LB edge (managed TLS, HTTPS-only, baseline DDoS), not from hiding the IP.

**Cost reality:** the LB forwarding rule is a flat **~$18/mo baseline per load balancer**,
regardless of traffic. Because one LB fronts every app and both TLDs, the 2nd…Nth app adds
**~$0**.

---

## The `deploy` job + Cloud Build (per app)

The template ships `cloudbuild.yaml` and the `validate` + `version-and-tag` jobs. The **`deploy`
job is per-app** — it names your project/SA/WIF and selects the target from the branch. Paste the
block below into `ci-cd.yml` (after `version-and-tag`) and fill the `<…>` placeholders — it is the
one hand-assembly step, so don't change these four load-bearing lines (the **attach contract**):

1. **`needs: version-and-tag`** — chains deploy onto the tag job in the same run.
2. **`if: github.event_name == 'push' && needs.version-and-tag.outputs.tag != ''`** — deploy only
   on push, and only if a tag was actually produced (a failed/blocked gate yields no tag → no
   deploy, no silent success).
3. **`ref: ${{ needs.version-and-tag.outputs.tag }}`** — check out the _tagged_ commit, so the
   build is exactly what was versioned (not whatever `HEAD` drifted to).
4. **the `--substitutions` set** — `TAG_NAME` / `_SERVICE` / `_APP_ENV` / `_APP_IS_PRODUCTION` are
   what `cloudbuild.yaml` reads; the `Select environment from branch` step derives them from
   `github.ref_name` (`dev` → `-staging` + `APP_ENV=staging` + chip on; `main` → prod defaults).

```yaml
deploy:
  name: deploy to Cloud Run
  needs: version-and-tag
  if: github.event_name == 'push' && needs.version-and-tag.outputs.tag != ''
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  permissions: { contents: read, id-token: write } # id-token for WIF
  env:
    PROJECT_ID: <project>
    REGION: <region>
    WIF_PROVIDER: projects/<project-number>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool/providers/github-provider
    DEPLOY_SA: <deployer-SA>
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      with: { ref: '${{ needs.version-and-tag.outputs.tag }}', fetch-depth: 0 }
    - name: Select environment from branch
      id: target
      run: |
        if [ "${GITHUB_REF_NAME}" = "dev" ]; then
          echo "service=<service>-staging" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          echo "app_env=staging" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          echo "is_production=false" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
        else
          echo "service=<service>" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          echo "app_env=" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          echo "is_production=true" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
        fi
    - uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
      with:
        {
          workload_identity_provider: '${{ env.WIF_PROVIDER }}',
          service_account: '${{ env.DEPLOY_SA }}',
        }
    - uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2
    - name: Build & deploy via Cloud Build
      run: |
        TAG="${{ needs.version-and-tag.outputs.tag }}"
        SHORT_SHA="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
        gcloud builds submit \
          --config=cloudbuild.yaml \
          --substitutions="TAG_NAME=${TAG},SHORT_SHA=${SHORT_SHA},_SERVICE=${{ steps.target.outputs.service }},_APP_ENV=${{ steps.target.outputs.app_env }},_APP_IS_PRODUCTION=${{ steps.target.outputs.is_production }}" \
          --service-account="projects/${PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/${DEPLOY_SA}" \
          --default-buckets-behavior=REGIONAL_USER_OWNED_BUCKET \
          --project="$PROJECT_ID" --region="$REGION" .
```

`cloudbuild.yaml` (shipped) stamps a UTC build date, builds the `Dockerfile` forwarding
`APP_VERSION` / `APP_IS_PRODUCTION` / `BUILD_GIT_COMMIT` / `BUILD_DATE` as build-args, tags the
image `<service>:<TAG>-<sha>`, pushes to Artifact Registry, and `gcloud run deploy`s with runtime
env (`NODE_ENV=production`, `APP_VERSION`, commit/date, and `APP_ENV` **only when non-empty** so
prod is never given a stray `APP_ENV=`). Its per-target knobs (`_SERVICE`, `_APP_ENV`,
`_APP_IS_PRODUCTION`) default to production, so the prod path is byte-identical to a non-staging
app.

Non-obvious build flags, each learned the hard way:

- **`--service-account`** — `gcloud builds submit` does **not** auto-run as the calling identity;
  without this it runs as the default compute SA. Set it to `<deployer-SA>`.
- **`--default-buckets-behavior=REGIONAL_USER_OWNED_BUCKET`** — **required** whenever a
  user-managed `--service-account` is set on a regional build, or the submit errors on the logs
  bucket.
- The plain `.` submit builds from the uploaded **working tree**, not the tagged commit — the
  `deploy` job checks out the tag first (`ref: <tag>`), so the tree IS the tagged commit.

### Cloud Build History legibility

Builds from many apps interleave in one project's History. `cloudbuild.yaml`'s `images:` (tagged
`<service>:vX.Y.Z-<shortsha>`) and `tags:` (`app-<service>`, `ref-vX.Y.Z`, `commit-<shortsha>`)
keep them filterable: `gcloud builds list --filter='tags=app-<service>'`. (Tag values can't
contain `/` or `=`; use `key-value` form.) The History **Ref** column stays blank for a plain
local submit; it's populated only by submitting from a **connected repo** with `--revision=vX.Y.Z`
— an opt-in add-on (next section).

---

## Connected-repo link (Ref column) — opt-in

**Skip it unless you want the History Ref column.** A 2nd-gen Cloud Build **repo connection** lets
you submit `--revision=vX.Y.Z` from the connected repo so History's **Ref** column shows the tag.
It is **only** a build _source_ — **not** a trigger, and it does **not** depend on webhook
delivery. The default local submit deploys identically without it. To use it, swap the final `.`
in the build command for the connected-repo resource and add `--revision=<tag>`.

Creating the connection needs a **one-time browser OAuth** the CLI can't do:

```bash
gcloud builds connections create github <conn-name> --region=<region> --project=<project>
# returns a PENDING_USER_OAUTH link → open it (correct Google + GitHub identities) →
# advance to PENDING_INSTALL_APP → SELECT THE EXISTING GitHub App installation and Continue
# (do NOT "install in another account") → COMPLETE
gcloud builds repositories create <repo> --connection=<conn-name> \
  --region=<region> --project=<project> \
  --remote-uri="https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git"
```

Prereq: the Cloud Build P4SA
(`service-<project-number>@gcp-sa-cloudbuild.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) needs
`roles/secretmanager.admin` (2nd-gen stores the OAuth token in Secret Manager).

---

## Adding a staging environment (per app)

Staging is **a second deploy of the same app, off the `dev` branch, to a second Cloud Run service
on the same load balancer** — production on `<app>.snackbyte.io`, staging on
`<app>.snackbyte.dev`. The branch + the derived `-dev` tag already drive it (no template change);
this is the per-app GCP wiring. One global LB serves **both TLDs** — the cert-map (§5) holds
hostnames across both, host-rules route each. No second LB, no second IP, **~$0 added**.

Per app, in addition to its production wiring:

1. **Cloud Run** — deploy a second service `<service>-staging`. Lock ingress to
   `internal-and-cloud-load-balancing` **and** bind `allUsers run.invoker` (§4 — both, or the LB
   403s). The `deploy` job sets `APP_ENV=staging` + `APP_IS_PRODUCTION=false` for it (label +
   chip); `NODE_ENV` stays `production` so the real version is read.
2. **Load balancer** — add a serverless NEG → backend for `<service>-staging`, a host-rule for
   `<app>.snackbyte.dev` on the existing URL map. (The flagship is typically the url-map's
   _default_ service; sibling apps are explicit host-rules.)
3. **TLS** — covered by the `*.snackbyte.dev` wildcard cert-map entry (§5); no per-app cert work.
4. **DNS** — one `A` record `<app>.snackbyte.dev → <LB-IP>` (the same LB IP as prod), TTL 600.
5. **WIF / SA** — reuse the existing pool/provider + `<deployer-SA>`; no new IAM for a public app.

### What the app reports

`/api/version` returns `environment` from `APP_ENV` (falling back to `NODE_ENV`). Staging keeps
`NODE_ENV=production` and sets `APP_ENV=staging`, so it reports `environment: "staging"` **with the
real version number**. (Labeling via `NODE_ENV` instead would flip the build's version gate off and
make `/api/version` report `0.0.0-dev` — don't.) Staging also serves an `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`
header so it isn't search-indexed; production emits no such header. The **version chip** is shown on
staging and hidden on production — driven by the `APP_IS_PRODUCTION` build-arg (default `true` =
hidden), not a runtime value.

### Promotion & rollback

- **Promote** staging → prod by fast-forwarding `main` to the `dev` commit (the gate, above). CI
  reuses the `-dev` number, drops the suffix, deploys prod. The same commit carries both tags; no
  second number is minted.
- **Roll back** either environment without a rebuild: each Cloud Run service keeps its revision
  history. `gcloud run services update-traffic <service|service-staging> --to-revisions=<prev>=100`
  flips back. The `vX.Y.Z[-dev]` tags map a number → its image for finding the revision to pin.

---

## Adding another app to the same project (the fleet pattern)

The project hosts many apps; each is its own repo → Cloud Run service → subdomain on the shared LB.
Per new app `<app>`:

1. **WIF binding** — reuse the existing pool/provider (the owner condition already allows all your
   repos); add one `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` binding for `…/attribute.repository/<owner>/<app>`
   on its deploy SA.
2. **Cloud Run** — deploys as a separate service; lock ingress **and** bind `allUsers run.invoker`
   (§4).
3. **Artifact Registry** — images namespaced by service automatically.
4. **Load balancer** — add a serverless NEG + backend + host-rule on the existing URL map; add one
   `A` record for the sub → same `<LB-IP>`. TLS is already covered by the wildcard cert (§5). **No
   new LB, no new IP, no cert work, ~$0 added.**
5. **Workflow** — copy `ci-cd.yml` and add the per-app `deploy` job (above), changing `_SERVICE`,
   the WIF principal, and the host.

---

## Operational gotchas

- **Version-line drift** — if the derivation fails on "tag vX.Y.Z already exists" for a number
  you didn't expect, you're likely re-running a job whose tag already landed (idempotent re-run is
  by job, not by re-deriving) or racing a concurrent push (the `concurrency` group should prevent
  the latter). For a deploy that failed _after_ tagging, re-run the `deploy` job alone (see
  Recovery, above) — don't re-run `version-and-tag`.
- **`main` ahead of `dev` after a hotfix** — a direct-to-`main` hotfix consumes a number `dev`
  hasn't seen, so `dev`'s next mint skips ahead and `main` is briefly ahead. Reconcile by updating
  `dev` from `main` before the next promotion (the promotion gate requires it).
- **`gcloud` auth expiry** — tokens expire ~hourly; re-auth with `gcloud auth login <account>`.
  Pass the right `--account` for the project (a machine may own several Google identities — the
  wrong one silently targets the wrong project).
- **`google-github-actions/*`** run on Node 20 (a deprecation warning; bump when convenient).
