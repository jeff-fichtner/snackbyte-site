# snackbyte-site

Vite + React + TypeScript app, deployed to Google Cloud Run.

## Develop

This app runs on Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`); confirm `node --version` prints `v24.x`
(`nvm use` switches to it in an interactive shell).

```bash
node --version   # expect v24.x
cp .env.example .env   # local environment values (PORT, etc.)
npm install
npm run dev      # dev server at the URL Vite prints
```

Create the `.env` from `.env.example` as part of setup — the defaults run without it,
but this app expects a `.env` for its local config, so set it up now rather than later.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # dev server
npm run build        # build the distribution into dist/
npm run start        # run the built server
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run format       # Prettier (write)
npm run typecheck    # tsc, frontend + backend
npm test             # Vitest
npm run check:all    # format check + lint + typecheck + test
```

## Rendering

Runtime-driven views render on the client. Where content is known at build time, it can be
prerendered to real HTML so those pages ship as markup rather than an empty shell.

Prerendering runs at **build** time, not in dev — so in `npm run dev` the page is the
empty shell (`<div id="root"></div>`) that React mounts into. Run `npm run build` to see
the prerendered markup.

## CI

A GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) gates pull requests and, on each push, runs
the checks and **derives a version tag from git history** — `dev` → `vX.Y.Z-dev` (staging),
`main` → `vX.Y.Z` (production). The PATCH is not stored in `package.json` (which holds only
`MAJOR.MINOR`); CI creates and pushes the **tag only**, never a commit. The tag is the deploy
signal.

**One-time setup, before the first push:** enable
**Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Read and write permissions"** (so CI
can push the tag), and set branch protection requiring the `validate (merge gate)` check. The
first push tags on success; without write permission the checks pass but the tag step 403s.
See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for the full versioning + CI/deploy model.

## Deploy

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh <service-name> <gcp-project> [region]   # builds the image and runs gcloud run deploy
```

Deploys a container to Cloud Run. Idle cost is near zero — Cloud Run scales to zero
and bills only while handling a request.

## Version

The app reports its version at `/api/version` and (in non-prod) a small on-page chip. The
server endpoint reads `APP_VERSION` / `BUILD_GIT_COMMIT` / `BUILD_DATE` from **runtime
environment variables** — `scripts/deploy.sh` sets these, so a deployed release reports
its true `vX.Y.Z` / commit / date at `/api/version`. Built and run locally (no deploy
env), it self-reports `0.0.0-dev` / `commit: dev` / `environment: development` — that's
expected, not a bug. (The frontend chip's version comes from `package.json` at build
time; its commit/date are populated only if the build passes them as Docker build-args —
see [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).)

## Spec-driven development

This project is set up for spec-driven development (GitHub Spec Kit). Nothing is
spec'd yet — start here:

1. **`/speckit-constitution`** — establish this app's principles. A few worth carrying
   forward (they apply broadly, not just to this app):
   - **Spec stays in spec spaces.** `specs/`, `.specify/`, `.claude/` are AI-assist
     scaffolding. Shipped code (`src/`, `tests/`, `README`, `docs/`, scripts) must
     stand on its own and never reference specs, FRs, or principle numbers — state the
     rule directly instead.
   - **Convention over configuration.** The tooling is set up and complete; don't
     re-litigate it per feature.
   - **Pinned, linted, type-safe, tested.** Node 24 LTS, TypeScript throughout, and
     `npm run check:all` (format + lint + typecheck + test) green on every change.
   - Then add principles specific to this app.
2. **`/speckit-specify`** → **`/speckit-plan`** → **`/speckit-tasks`** →
   **`/speckit-implement`** — one feature at a time, one branch per feature.
